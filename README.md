# Employee-Tracker

relatively large businesses need ways of tracking their employees, and this tracker is the simplest way to do it.

## Description

This employee tracker allows a manager to see who works for them, which department they are in, how much they earn, as well as their role.
When the manager starts the program in the console, they are given a range of options from viewing all employees, to viewing all departments and viewing all roles.
They have the option to update the employee information.
